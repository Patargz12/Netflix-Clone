# Netflix Clone - ReactJS, Zustand, and TanStack Query Practice

![Netflix Clone]

This project is a Netflix clone built as a way for me to study and practice **ReactJS**, **Zustand** (state management), and **TanStack Query** (data fetching and caching). It also serves as an opportunity to improve my skills in API integration and working with design systems.

## Features

- **Netflix-like UI**: Built using a design system from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1345502663442900887).
- **API Integration**: Utilizes two APIs:
  - **Fake Store API**: For authentication and user management.
  - **TMDB API**: For fetching movie data, including popular movies, genres, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **State Management**: Uses **Zustand** for global state management.
- **Data Fetching**: Leverages **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching and caching.
